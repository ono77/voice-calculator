    <p>
      This page describes the <strong>Terms of Use</strong> and the <strong>Privacy Policy</strong> that apply to the
      <em>Free Voice Calculator</em> Chrome extension (the “Extension”). By installing or using the Extension, you agree
      to these terms. If you do not agree, please do not install or use the Extension.
    </p>

    <!-- TERMS OF USE -->
    <h2>1. Terms of Use</h2>

    <h3>1.1. Use of the Extension</h3>
    <p>
      The Extension is provided for your personal and non-commercial use. You may use it to perform mathematical
      calculations with keyboard input or using your voice, as designed by the developer.
    </p>

    <h3>1.2. No warranty</h3>
    <p>
      The Extension is provided on an <strong>“AS IS”</strong> and <strong>“AS AVAILABLE”</strong> basis, without any
      warranties of any kind, whether express or implied. This includes, but is not limited to, any warranty of
      accuracy, reliability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement.
    </p>
    <p>
      While the Extension attempts to interpret numbers and operations from your voice (in English, Italian, Spanish and
      French), the recognition and parsing of expressions may not always be correct. You are responsible for verifying
      the results and should not rely on the Extension for any critical, financial, medical or safety-related decisions.
    </p>

    <h3>1.3. User responsibilities</h3>
    <p>By using the Extension, you agree that you will not:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Use the Extension for any illegal or unauthorized purpose.</li>
      <li>Attempt to reverse engineer, modify, copy or redistribute the Extension, except where explicitly allowed by law.</li>
      <li>Interfere with or disrupt the normal operation of the Extension or Chrome Web Store.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>1.4. Limitation of liability</h3>
    <p>
      To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, the developer of the Extension shall not be liable for any
      direct, indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or exemplary damages arising out of or in connection with
      your use of (or inability to use) the Extension, including any loss of data, errors in calculations, or any other
      damages, even if advised of the possibility of such damages.
    </p>

    <h3>1.5. Changes to the Extension</h3>
    <p>
      Features and functionality of the Extension may be updated, changed, or removed at any time, without prior notice.
      The developer is under no obligation to maintain or support the Extension indefinitely.
    </p>

    <h3>1.6. Termination</h3>
    <p>
      You may stop using the Extension at any time by removing it from your browser. The developer may also suspend or
      discontinue the Extension at any time, for any reason, without notice.
    </p>

    <!-- PRIVACY POLICY -->
    <h2>2. Privacy Policy</h2>

    <p>
      This Privacy Policy explains how the Extension handles information when you use it. The Extension is designed to
      be privacy-friendly and to collect as little data as possible.
    </p>

    <h3>2.1. Data processed by the Extension</h3>
    <p>
      When you click the microphone icon, the Extension uses the browser’s built-in
      <strong>Web Speech API</strong> (or equivalent speech recognition engine) to convert your voice into text.
      This process is handled by your browser and/or the underlying platform, and may rely on external services
      provided by the browser vendor (for example, Google services in Chrome).
    </p>
    <p>
      The Extension itself uses the recognized text only to:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Try to interpret the spoken expression as a mathematical operation (e.g. “27.4 divided by 4.3”).</li>
      <li>Display the recognized text in the popup UI.</li>
      <li>Calculate and display the result locally in the popup.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2.2. No collection of personal data by the Extension</h3>
    <p>
      The Extension does <strong>not</strong> collect, store, transmit, sell, or share personal data such as your name,
      email address, account details, or browsing history.
    </p>
    <p>In particular:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The recognized speech text is used only in memory, for the duration of the current calculation.</li>
      <li>No transcript is sent to the developer’s servers.</li>
      <li>No analytics, tracking scripts, or advertising networks are integrated in the Extension.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2.3. Microphone access</h3>
    <p>
      The Extension only requests access to the microphone when you explicitly click the microphone icon in the popup.
      Permission to use the microphone is managed by your browser. You can allow or deny this permission, and you can
      revoke it at any time via your browser’s site/extension settings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Audio input is processed by the browser’s speech recognition engine. The Extension does not record or store audio
      itself.
    </p>

    <h3>2.4. Permissions used by the Extension</h3>
    <p>
      The Extension may request certain Chrome permissions such as:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>activeTab</strong> – to interact with the current tab if necessary for voice activation.</li>
      <li><strong>microphone</strong> (via browser prompt) – to allow speech recognition when you choose to use voice input.</li>
      <li><strong>storage</strong> – possibly used to store simple settings or preferences locally in your browser.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      These permissions are used solely to provide the voice calculator functionality and related options. The Extension
      does not use them to track you or profile your activity.
    </p>

    <h3>2.5. Third-party services</h3>
    <p>
      Speech recognition is performed using the browser’s own implementation of the Web Speech API or an equivalent
      platform feature. This may involve third-party services (for example, Google’s speech recognition systems in
      Chrome). Data sent to such third parties is handled according to their own privacy policies.
    </p>
    <p>
      You should consult your browser vendor’s privacy policy for more information on how speech data may be processed
      by the underlying platform.
    </p>

    <h3>2.6. Children’s privacy</h3>
    <p>
      The Extension is not specifically directed at children. It does not knowingly collect or process personal
      information about children. If you are a parent or guardian and believe that your child is using the Extension in
      a way that exposes personal data, you can remove the Extension from the browser at any time.
    </p>

    <h3>2.7. Data security</h3>
    <p>
      Since the Extension does not store personal data on external servers, the primary security considerations relate
      to your device, browser and operating system. You are responsible for maintaining the security of your device and
      your browser settings.
    </p>

    <h3>2.8. Changes to this Policy</h3>
    <p>
      This Terms of Use and Privacy Policy document may be updated from time to time, for example to reflect changes in
      browser APIs, legal requirements, or new functionality in the Extension. The “Last updated” date at the top of
      this page will be revised accordingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Continued use of the Extension after such changes constitutes your acceptance of the updated terms and policy.
    </p>

    <h3>2.9. Contact</h3>
    <p>
      If you have any questions about these Terms of Use or this Privacy Policy, you may contact the developer using
      the contact information provided on the official website or on the Chrome Web Store listing page.
